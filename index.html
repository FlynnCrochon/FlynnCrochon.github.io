	<h2>Spanish Discovery of Inca</h2>
	<p>After Christopher Columbus discovered the new world, the Spanish empire chose to take over the Inca in order to colonise America.  Spain sent 152 soldiers, and as shown by our primary source, despite having a numbers advantage the Sapa Inca named Atahualpa was captured and killed by Spaniards.

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Impact to the government after the Spanish arrived</h2>
	<p>The Spanish captured the Sapa in the battle of Cajamarca and he was then sent to death. The Spanish still let the Incas have their own king after that but he is only a puppet, the Inca government was then failed and everything in under the control of the Spanish.</p>
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Changes in Social Structure</h2>
	<p>After the Inca was taken over by Spain, their religion was partially altered to Christianity.  This meant that their priests which used to be extremely high ranked within their society lost a lot of their power.  </p>
