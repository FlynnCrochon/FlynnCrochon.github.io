	<h2>Intro</h2>
	<p>
		The Inca Empire is a civilization from years
		1438-1533 AD. The administrative, political
		and military centre was located in
		modern-day Peru. It’s political and administrative structure
		“was the most sophisticated found among
		native peoples” in the Americas.

	<h2>The Social Pyramid</h2>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Sapa Inca</h2>
	<p>The Sapa Inca was the king of Inca society.  He was considered like a god by Inca society and led the nation as its absolute ruler.</p>

	<img src="inca1.jpg" class = "img">
	<img src="sapa.jpg" class = "img">


</div>


<div class = "block">
	<h2>The Ayllu</h2>
	<p>The Ayllu were the basic unit of Inca society.  The Ayllu was made up of a number of families, which worked together as if they were one large family.  No matter what their social status was, everyone was a part of The Ayllu.</p>
</div>


<div class = "block">
	<h2>Noble Classes</h2>
	<p>The noble class were just under the Sapa Inca in rank.  They had more power than the other parts of Inca society, and they acted as leaders to rule the rest of the population.</p>
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Villac Umu</h2>
	<p>The Villac Umu was the high priest, able to speak directly to the sun god Inti.  Due to the importance of religion in Inca society the Villac Umu was just behind the Sapa Inca in terms of social status.</p>
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Royal Family</h2>
	<p>The royal family was extremely important to the Inca.  Direct relatives of the Sapa Inca received high positions in government, and the main wife of the Sapa Inca was the queen known as The Coya.</p>
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Public Administrators</h2>
	<p>After the noble class came the public administrators.  This class provided a connection between the noble classes and commoners, without affecting the lives of the nobles.</p>
	<img src="fullboddy.gif" class = "img">
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Inca by Privilege</h2>
	<p>When the Sapa Inca needed more people he could trust in high positions, a new lass was created called “Inca by privilege”.  These people were considered nobles, but not as high in class as the true Inca.</p>
	
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Curacas</h2>
	<p>Curacas’ were the leaders of the tribes conquered by the Inca.  They were often left as the leaders of their tribes.  They had to report to the Inca, and could keep their position as long as they stayed loyal.</p>
	
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Tax Collectors</h2>
	<p>Each group of families had a tax collector look over them.  Higher level tax collectors kept an eye on lower tax collectors, and they had a distinct hierarchy.</p>
	
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Record Keepers</h2>
	<p>Record Keepers were considered to be generally equal to tax collectors.  Their roles were to track which families had paid their taxes, and where supplies were stored.</p>
	
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Commoners</h2>
	<p>This is the most important class who are the main population in the empire, they have to work for the nobles and the enjoy less freedom. Some example of them are the farmers, and the Artisans, but the artisans is in a higher level then the artisans.</p>
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Artisans</h2>
	<p>Artisans worked on crafts such as pottery or gold jewellery for the noble class.  Though they were commoners, they were considered a higher rank than farmers.</p>
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Farmers</h2>
	<p>Farmers made up the largest percentage of the Inca Empire.  They were forced to send two-thirds of their crops to the government and priests.</p>
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Army</h2>
	<p>There are about 200000 men in the empire who act as the military force, they are mainly commanded by commanders who are usually the members of the royal family.10 men are commanded by a commander called chunka kamayuq, 100 by a pachaka kuraka, 1,000 men by a waranqa kuraka, and lastly 10,000 led by a hunu kuraka. They are all then under the control of the Sapa Inca.</p>

	<h2>The Columbian Exchange</h2>
	<p>The Columbium Exchange was the exchange of resources between the old world and the new world.  Some key resources exchanged from Europe to the America’s were livestock, coffee beans, sugar cane and diseases.  Key resources sent to Europe included tobacco, turkey and a number of fruits and veggies like corn and tomato’s.</p>
	<img src="exchange.gif" class = "img">
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>How Social Structure was Affected by the Columbian Exchange</h2>
	<p>The Inca’s social structure was heavily affected by the Columbium Exchange.  Due to the food sent to America having diseases, the Incan population decreased. Additionally, after Christopher Columbus discovered the America’s, other nations learnt of their existence.</p>

</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Spanish Discovery of Inca</h2>
	<p>After Christopher Columbus discovered the new world, the Spanish empire chose to take over the Inca in order to colonise America.  Spain sent 152 soldiers, and as shown by our primary source, despite having a numbers advantage the Sapa Inca named Atahualpa was captured and killed by Spaniards.  This led to a number of changes in the Incan social structure and government.</p>
	<img src="effected2.jpg" class = "img">
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Impact to the government after the Spanish arrived</h2>
	<p>The Spanish captured the Sapa in the battle of Cajamarca and he was then sent to death. The Spanish still let the Incas have their own king after that but he is only a puppet, the Inca government was then failed and everything in under the control of the Spanish.</p>
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Changes in Government</h2>
	<p>After the Spanish killed Atahualpa, as shown in our primary source, the Incan people were still allowed their own king.  However, this king was a puppet.  The Spanish people, with the king on their side altered the government in a way to give Spain control. There were a number of uprisings attempted by the Incan citizens, but these failed resulting in complete Spanish power over their nation.</p>

	<p>A key change in government after Spain gained control was the “Mita” policy.  This system made all people work for a certain period.  This labour was free for the government.  When someone’s turn came (Mita means term), they joined Mita for 65 days.  Government took care of the family who had people absent working in Mita.</p>

</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Extra Mita Info</h2>
	<p>When working for Mita, people worked on: <br>
Houses <br>
Fields <br>
Monuments <br>
Mines <br>
However, the Mita system was misused by the Spanish for mining gold and silver for the crown.  People were also baptised.  
Ultimately, the Mita system became slavery under the façade of educating and converting Inca society.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "block">
	<h2>Changes in Social Structure</h2>
	<p>After the Inca was taken over by Spain, their religion was partially altered to Christianity.  This meant that their priests which used to be extremely high ranked within their society lost a lot of their power.  </p>
